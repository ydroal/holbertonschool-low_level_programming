 - More functions, more nested loops

 This is the project with C.
 learn about nested loops, function and Scope of variables.

## Learning Objectives

 * What are nested loops and how to use them
 * What is a function and how do you use functions
 * What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
 * What is a prototype
 * Scope of variables
 * What are the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89
 * What are header files and how to to use them with #include

## Tasks

### 0. make -f 0-Makefile
