# C - Functions, nested loops

This is the project with C.
learn about functions, nested loops, and Scope of variables.

## Learning Objectives

* What are nested loops and how to use them
* What is a function and how do you use functions
* What is the difference between a declaration and a definition of a function
* What is a prototype
* Scope of variables
* What are the gcc flags -Wall -Werror -pedantic -Wextra -std=gnu89
* What are header files and how to to use them with #include

## Tasks

### 0. _putchar
Write a program that prints _putchar, followed by a new line.

### 1. I sometimes suffer from insomnia. And when I can't fall asleep, I play what I call the alphabet game
Write a function that prints the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
    * Prototype: void print_alphabet(void);
        * You can only use _putchar twice in your code

### 2. 10 x alphabet
	Write a function that prints 10 times the alphabet, in lowercase, followed by a new line.
	    * Prototype: void print_alphabet_x10(void);
	        * You can only use _putchar twice in your code
