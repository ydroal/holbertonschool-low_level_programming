# C - Static libraries

This is the project with C.
learn about Recursion.

## Learning Objectives

* What is recursion
* How to implement recursion
* In what situations you should implement recursion
* In what situations you shouldnâ€™t implement recursion

## Tasks

### 0-puts_recursion.c
Write a function that prints a string, followed by a new line.

### 1-print_rev_recursion.c
Write a function that prints a string in reverse.

### 2-strlen_recursion.c
Write a function that returns the length of a string.

### 3-factorial.c
Write a function that returns the factorial of a given number.

### 4-pow_recursion.c
Write a function that returns the value of x raised to the power of y.
* If y is lower than 0, the function should return -1

### 5-sqrt_recursion.c
Write a function that returns the natural square root of a number.
* If n does not have a natural square root, the function should return -1

### 6-is_prime_number.c
Write a function that returns 1 if the input integer is a prime number, otherwise return 0.
